# stringmetric

String metrics and phonetic algorithms for Go (based on the hyper cool [rockymadden/stringmetric](https://github.com/rockymadden/stringmetric) Scala library). The library provides "facilities to perform approximate string matching, measurement of string similarity/distance, indexing by word pronunciation, and sounds-like comparisons", as of the Scala implementation itself.

## Supported metrics and algorithms (in order of implementation)

* __[Sørensen–Dice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice%27s_coefficient)__ (Similarity metric)
* __[Hamming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)__ (Similarity metric)
